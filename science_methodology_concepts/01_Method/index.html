<h1 id="method">Method</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-you-know">What do you know?</h2>
<p>Here are some questions to answer before reading further</p>
<ol>
<li>What is a "method"? What are some examples you can think of?</li>
<li>What makes something "scientific"?</li>
<li>What is the scientific method?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p><strong>01 - Methods are an approach to predictable results</strong></p>
<p>This may not sound particularly insightful, but starting from this general
concept, we will explore it for now in a very specific context.</p>
<p>Let's start with a tentative definition for the scientific method:</p>
<p>The <strong>Scientific Method</strong> is the idea that <strong>questions about the natural</strong> world
can by answered by <strong>following some set of steps</strong> to <strong>acquire knowledge</strong>
and <strong>explain that knowledge</strong> in the form of a <strong>hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy-and-inquiry">Philosophy and inquiry</h3>
<p>When we ask "what something is?" we are immediately in the realm of philosophy.
Philosophy is a deep and wonderful area of human knowledge. It is <em>not</em> science,
but for centuries it has explored important questions scientists would do well not to ignore</p>
<h4 id="philosophy-does">Philosophy does</h4>
<p><strong>Concept Clarification</strong>: One of the tasks of philosophy is to clarify what
we mean when we say something. Take the phrase "it's a beautiful day." What is
beauty? What is the day? Philosophy is nearly endless in its pursuit of
questions, and questions of the form "what is X?" lead to entire fields of
philosophical study (e.g. "what is beauty" is the subject of aesthetics; "what
is a part and what is a whole?" is the subject of mereology).</p>
<p>Philosophy tries to help us be clear about words and their meaning, and what
we mean when we use those words.</p>
<p>To get quickly to the practical, how do we benefit from the work philosophy
does? Here are four questions philosophy has worked on and that we can learn
from:</p>
<h4 id="philosophy-asks">Philosophy asks</h4>
<p><strong>What is knowledge?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">Epistemology
- επιστημολογία<sup>*</sup></a>
is a branch of philosophy that asks the question how can we know something?
What is evidence for/against something? How and when should we trust (or refuse
to trust) evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important
questions in the sciences.</p>
<p><strong>What is logical?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">Logic - λογική</a> is a branch of philosophy
which asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise
(e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g.
Socrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise
to mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is <strong>not</strong> a
science).</p>
<p><strong>How do we communicate our meaning?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_language">Philosophy of language</a>
asks how do we use words (or signs; see semantics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">σημαντικός</a>) to represent abstract concepts? In the
English language for example, I can "<em>know</em> that I have 3 dollars in my
pocket" and I can "<em>know</em> how my friend thinks." Spanish, like other Romance
languages distinguishes between knowing a fact (verb: saber) from knowing
someone you have relationship with (verb: conocer).</p>
<p>Ultimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical
conclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently
scientific, but they are used by science.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science">Philosophy of science</a> is
concerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in
the sciences.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Take home message</strong>: Science makes use of philosophical tools (methods) to do
its work. At some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><sup>*</sup>Note</strong>: Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of
Greek terms this is not meant to privilege Greek or Western thought. Every
human culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to
suggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the
best one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its
antecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw
attention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to
acknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these
are the only possible ways to think about these terms.</p>
<h2 id="key-questions">Key questions</h2>
<p>After that detour through philosophy, how do we bring those ideas back to
science? Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's
return to the one suggested above:</p>
<hr />
<p>The <strong>Scientific Method</strong> is the idea that <strong>questions about the natural</strong> world
can by answered by <strong>following some set of steps</strong> to <strong>acquire knowledge</strong>
about the world and <strong>explain that knowledge</strong> in the form of a <strong>hypothesis</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Using this definition, and the one you posed in the <strong>What do you know</strong>
questions, here are some additional ones to ask.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in
   in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a
   criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the
   Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano
   presented at a science fair scientific?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the "natural world"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the scientific method, what other methods do you think we might see
   used in science?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>About short essay assignments</strong></p>
<p>Short essay assignments are typed, 500 words maximum or less. In addition to
  getting to know your thoughts they are also a chance to get feedback on
  your writing. You will usually have a minimum of two weeks to complete these
  assignments. It is highly suggested that you give yourself time to write a
  first draft, reflect and/or get feedback, and write a final draft.</p>
<hr />
<p>Write a short essay on the following topic:</p>
<p><strong>The scientific method is a unique form of inquiry</strong></p>
<p>The point of your essay can be to support or refute the above statement; it's
your choice which position to support.</p>
<p>Think about breaking up this essay into 3 sections</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to the scientific method</li>
<li>A body where you contrast the scientific method with one or more other forms
  of inquiry (for example, how does the scientific method compare to how a
  fiction author explores a character in a novel).</li>
<li>A conclusion where you summarize your thoughts</li>
</ul>
<p>This is something more of an English assignment rather than a scientific writing
assignment. You may have any opinion or position you want, but develop your
ideas clearly and keep your writing simple.</p>

  approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles
  vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin
  pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that,
  fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most
  successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking
  body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological
  advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human
  talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This
  wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of
  scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have
  refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates
  the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the
  ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical
  rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of
  apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the
  benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system
  to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the
  eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing
  with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack
  takes readers beyond the "Science Wars" to a balanced understanding of the
  value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.</li>
